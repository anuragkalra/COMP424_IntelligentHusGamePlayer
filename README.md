# IntelligentHusGamePlayer
Intelligent board game player implementing the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 

This was the core project of our COMP 424 - Artificial Intelligence class, taught by Professor Joelle Pineau at McGill University in the Winter 2016 semester.

A large code package was provided by the Professor and the project TA, implementing the GUI, client-server interactions, the boardgame logic, a script for running repetitive tests on various agents, as well as some other code.

Our task was to implement a method that, given a HusBoardState object, returns the "best" move. The Minimax algorithm was used, as well as several domain specific heuristics that were implemented.

My implementation of the
