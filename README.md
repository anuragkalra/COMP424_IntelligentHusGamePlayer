# IntelligentHusGamePlayer
Intelligent board game player implementing the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 

This was the core project of our COMP 424 - Artificial Intelligence class, taught by Professor Joelle Pineau at McGill University in the Winter 2016 semester.

A large code package was provided by the Professor and the project TA, implementing the GUI, client-server interactions, the boardgame logic, a script for running repetitive tests on various agents, as well as some other code. I have not included these files in my repository, as I do not have explicit permission from the professor. The organization of the code (including the code provided by the professor) is outlined in the code_description.pdf file. The project_description.pdf file also includes some important information.

Our task was to implement a method that, given a HusBoardState object, returns the "best" move. The Minimax algorithm was used, as well as several domain specific heuristics that were implemented.

My implementation of the chooseMove() method is within the StudentPlayer.java source file.
